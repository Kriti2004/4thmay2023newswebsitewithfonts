        <img src="./img/a.png">
        <p>Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the promise of a ban on Bajrang Dal, the youth wing of the Vishva Hindu Parishad, in the Congress manifesto is an example of stupidity. As the minister cast her vote, she said, "We always respect Bajrang Bali and read Hanuman Chalisa. But for the Congress, it is an election issue. Karnataka is the birthplace of Hanuman ji.</p>
        <p>The Bajrang Dal ban promise turned into a massive controversy as PM Modi invoked Bajrang Bali and the Congress accused the BJP of equating Bajrang Bali with bajrang Dal.</p>
        <p>Congress Karnataka chief DK Shivakumar on Tuesday offered prayers to a gas cyliner in an attempt to remind the voters of gas prices. The Congress reupped an old video of Narendra Modi where he urged the same and DKS said he only asked the people to follow the same thing.</p>
        <p>Sitharaman cast her vote at the Bharath Education Society polling booth in Jayanagar, Bengaluru.</p>

        <img src="./img/e.png">
        <p>The memorial gate was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, who was not only the main architect of New Delhi but also a member of the Imperial War Graves Commission and one of Europe's foremost designers of war graves and memorials. </p>
        <p>Ten years after the foundation stone's laying on 12 February 1931, the memorial was inaugurated by Lord Irwin, who, on the occasion, said "those who after us shall look upon this monument may learn in pondering its purpose something of that sacrifice and service which the names upon its walls record."[5] In the decade between the laying of foundation stone of the memorial and its inauguration, the rail-line was shifted to run along the Yamuna River, and the New Delhi Railway Station was opened in 1926</p>
        <p>In 2017, the India Gate was twinned with the Arch of Remembrance in Leicester, England,[further explanation needed] another Lutyens war memorial, following a very similar design but on a smaller scale. In a ceremony, India's high commissioner to the United Kingdom laid a wreath at the arch in Leicester and the British high commissioner to India laid one at the India Gate.</p>

        <p>It is expected to make a soft-landing on Moon at 2.58am on September 7, making India only the fourth nation – after the US, Russia and China – to achieve such a feat.  </p>
        <p>The month of September brings some hope for skywatchers in India as the southwest monsoon has entered an apparent break phase in many parts of the country. With subdued rainfall, the sky is all set to show a few glimpses of beautiful evening colours followed by a dark night sky. Moreover, the lower levels of pollution in September will also set the stage with ideal conditions for good sky observation.</p>
        <p>The bright red Mars will be very close to the gibbous moon. In fact, for South Central America, Mars will be occulted by the Moon. Mars is approaching the closest position to Earth and hence will keep on rising earlier each day in September and will become very bright red.</p>
        <p>Tonight Uranus will be just 3 degrees near the Moon and therefore, has a good chance to be spotted. Look for Moon and just off the field towards the North can be seen the green dot of Uranus.</p>
